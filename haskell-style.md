Haskell Style Guide
===================

This is a short document describing the preferred coding style for
this project.  I've tried to cover the major areas of formatting and
naming.  When something isn't covered by this guide you should stay
consistent with the code in the other modules.

1. Formatting
-------------

### Line Length

Maximum line length is *80 characters*.

### Indentation

Tabs are illegal. Use spaces for indenting.  Indent your code blocks
with *4 spaces*.  Indent the `where` keyword two spaces to set it
apart from the rest of the code and indent the definitions in a
`where` clause 2 spaces. Some examples:

    sayHello :: IO ()
    sayHello = do
        name <- getLine
        putStrLn $ greeting name
      where
        greeting name = "Hello, " ++ name ++ "!"

    filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
    filter _ []     = []
    filter p (x:xs)
        | p x       = x : filter p xs
        | otherwise = filter p xs

### Blank Lines

One blank line between top-level definitions.  No blank lines between
type signatures and function definitions.  Add one blank line between
functions in a type class instance declaration if the functions bodies
are large.  Use your judgement.

### Whitespace

Surround binary operators with a single space on either side.  Use
your better judgment for the insertion of spaces around arithmetic
operators but always be consistent about whitespace on either side of
a binary operator.  Don't insert a space after a lambda.

### Data Declarations

Align the constructors in a data type definition.  Example:

    data Tree a = Branch a (Tree a) (Tree a)
                | Leaf

or, if the declaration of the constructor is longer

    data Tree a
      = Branch a (Tree a) (Tree a)
      | Leaf

Format records as follows:

    data Person = Person
      { firstName :: String  -- ^ First name
      , lastName  :: String  -- ^ Last name
      , age       :: Int     -- ^ Age
      } deriving (Eq, Show)

or

    data Person
      = Person
          { firstName :: String  -- ^ First name
          , lastName  :: String  -- ^ Last name
          , age       :: Int     -- ^ Age
          }
      | Martian
          { name :: String
          , age  :: Int
          }
      deriving (Eq, Show)

### Pragmas

Put pragmas immediately following the function they apply to.
Example:

    id :: a -> a
    id x = x
    {-# INLINE id #-}

In the case of data type definitions you must put the pragma before
the type it applies to.  Example:

    data Array e = Array
        {-# UNPACK #-} !Int
        !ByteArray

### Hanging Lambdas

You may or may not indent the code following a "hanging" lambda.  Use
your judgement. Some examples:

    bar :: IO ()
    bar = forM_ [1, 2, 3] $ \n ->
              putStrLn "Here comes a number!"
              print n

    foo :: IO ()
    foo = alloca 10 $ \a ->
          alloca 20 $ \b ->
          cFunction a b

2. Imports
----------

Imports should be grouped and ordered from most specific to least
specific, i.e.:

1. same module hierarchy level
2. local application/library specific imports
3. related third party imports
4. standard library imports

Put a blank line between each group of imports.  The imports in each
group should be sorted alphabetically, by module name.

Always use explicit import lists or `qualified` imports for standard
and third party libraries.  This makes the code more robust against
changes in these libraries.  Exception: The Prelude.

3. Comments
-----------

### Line Length

Maximum line length is *70 characters*.  This increases readability as
the eye has to travel back to the start of the next line.

### Punctuation

Write proper sentences; start with a capital letter and use proper
punctuation.

### Top-Level Definitions

Comment every top level function (particularly exported functions),
and provide a type signature; use Haddock syntax in the comments.
Comment every exported data type.  Some examples:

    -- | Send a message on a socket.  The socket must be in a connected
    -- state.  Returns the number of bytes sent.  Applications are
    -- responsible for ensuring that all data has been sent.
    send :: Socket      -- ^ Connected socket
         -> ByteString  -- ^ Data to send
         -> IO Int      -- ^ Bytes sent

    -- | Bla bla bla.
    data Person = Person
        { age  :: Int     -- ^ Age
        , name :: String  -- ^ First name
        }

For functions the documentation should give enough information to
apply the function without looking at the functions definition.

### End-of-Line Comments

Separate end-of-line comments from the code using 2 spaces.  Align
comments for data type definitions.  Some examples:

    data Parser = Parser
        Int         -- Current position
        ByteString  -- Remaining input

    foo :: Int -> Int
    foo n = salt * 32 + 9
      where
        salt = 453645243  -- Magic hash salt.

4. Naming
---------

Use mixed-case when naming functions and camel-case when naming data
types.  There are a few exceptions that are widely used.

1. QuickCheck properties use a `prop_` prefix.
2. FFI wrapper use a `c_` prefix.

For readability reasons, don't capitalize all letters when using an
abbreviation.  For example, write `HttpServer` instead of
`HTTPServer`.  Exception: Two letter abbreviations, e.g. `IO`.

5. Misc
-------

### Warnings ###

Code should be compilable with `-Wall -Werror`. There should be no
warnings.
